# React Portfolio (Tailwind)

This is a small React + Vite + Tailwind project that reproduces the provided landing page screenshot.

Quick start (PowerShell on Windows):

```powershell
cd react-portfolio
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the dev server URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

Notes:
- Images are represented by blank blue squares as requested.
- Components are split into `NavBar` and `Hero` inside `src/components`.
- Tailwind is already configured; after installing dependencies the dev server will work.

If you want, I can run `npm install` and start the dev server for you now.
